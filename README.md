# JmeterPerf
Dynamically generate JMeter test plans, run performance tests, generate reports, compare reports and more using JMeter and Ruby.
Inspired by the now archived/defunct [ruby-jmeter](https://github.com/flood-io/ruby-jmeter).

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add jmeter_perf

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install jmeter_perf

## Usage

Check out the Wiki! https://github.com/jlurena/jmeter_perf/wiki

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Run `rake` to run the linter and tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

Additionally, there is an `example` Rails Application you can play with.
